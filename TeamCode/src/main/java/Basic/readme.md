This module will be used for basic codes such as moving servos, motors, and basic Mecanum drivetrain code

Also for basic autonomous using pedro pathing 

My hope is this allows easy access for many beginners who want to look at my format of coding / other samples of coding 

I'll try to make all of these commented as much as possible... can't say the rest of the code will be this commented
